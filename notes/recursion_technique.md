### The algorithmic steps for implementing recursion in a function are as follows:([link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-recursion-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/))
---
#### Steps:-
1. Define a base case: Identify the simplest case for which the solution is known or trivial. This is the stopping condition for the recursion, as it prevents the function from infinitely calling itself.

2. Define a recursive case: Define the problem in terms of smaller subproblems. Break the problem down into smaller versions of itself, and call the function recursively to solve each subproblem.

3. Ensure the recursion terminates: Make sure that the recursive function eventually reaches the base case, and does not enter an infinite loop.

4. Combine the solutions: Combine the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original problem.


**Note**:-
The base case no. might depend on the number of recursion function arguments.
