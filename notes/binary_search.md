### Binary search

#### Points to notes:-
1. problems suggest to search in O(log n) time.
2. In this problems we should focus on mid,left,right logic to shift them accordingly.(conditon should be checked with mid)
3. according to condition we can take left,right -> mid -+ 1

**Note**
not only first approach to left hand side but can be right side of binary tree format(https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)
